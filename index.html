    <p>Circus Baby (commonly referred to as Baby) is the secondary antagonist of the Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s 
        series and the animatronic mascot of Circus Baby's Pizza World invented by Afton Robotics, LLC and made for Fazbear

        Baby is haunted by the soul of
         Elizabeth Afton, who was the daughter
          of the serial killer William Afton. However, during the completion ending, Elizabeth's
           soul was presumably set free.

                                killing children for William Afton. Indeed, Bon Bon was fitted with a 360 
                                degree pivot what allows it to track where parents are to allow Freddy to lure the child away.
